# Hacker101 CTF

## 1. A little something to get you started

### 1.1. Flag0

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:

0. In the `html` `header` `style` find the url of an image we shouldn't be able to access. `body {background-image: url("background.png");}`
1. Copy the url of the image and paste it into the address line after the current address separated by a `/`. `http://<current-domain>/background.png` Hit enter and see what we shouldn't.

## 2. Micro-CMS v1

### 2.1. Flag0

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:
0. Create a new page and notice the url is `./page/10`
1. Since `page 1` and `page 2` are accessible through the home page try to access all the other pages from 3 to 9 until you find the one which is `Forbidden` (startus: `403`) instead of `Not Found` (startus: `404`).
2. Try to `Edit` this page by manipulating the url based on the parameters of accessible edit pages `./page/edit/<number-of-the-forbidden-page>`
3. See we can access the edit page which we shouldn't be able to do so

### 2.2. Flag1

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:
0. On the Create page `./page/create` in the `<input name='title'>` field type `<script>alert('hello');</script>`
1. Type anything in the text field for example `xss` or simpy just leave it blank.
2. Click on the Create button `<input type="submit" value="Create">`
3. Go to the `home` page (and see the alert window popping up)

### 2.3. Flag2

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:
0. Navigate to an Edit page `./page/edit/1`
1. Try to write some SQL Injection to the address bar after the url. For example: `'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 1 OR 1=1--` or `'--`
2. Hit `enter` and see the results.

### 2.4. Flag3

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:
0. On the Home page Click on `Create a new page`
1. In the `<textarea name="body">` field  try some XSS other than `<script>`. For example: `<body onload=alert('xss');>`
2. Give any title `other xss` for instance
3. Click `Create` button
4. On the created page see the alert (or check for the flag in the browser devtools html body)

## 3. Micro-CMS v2

#### Pre requirements:
First of all you will need some kind of `intercepting proxies` like `Burp Suite` or `OWASP ZAP`

##### Setting up Burp with firefox on ubuntu:
- Download `Burp Suite Community Edition` https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-4-5?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=
- Installation

    terminal:

    1. Open the Downloads Folder:
        > cd Downloads
    2. Make sure you've got the expected file downloaded:
        > ls
    3. Make the executable:
        > chmod +x burpsuite_community_linux_v2024_4_5.sh
    4. Run it:
        > sudo ./burpsuite_community_linux_v2024_4_5.sh
    5. Go through the installation process (leave the two paths as they are if possible)
    6. Open up Burp:
        > BurpSuiteCommunity
- Setting up

    ###### Open Port
    
    1. In Burp go to the Proxy tab > click on Proxy Settings
    2. Check which port Burp is listening on. Usually `127.0.0.1.8080`.
    You can change it if this port is already in use or for any other reason.
    3. Also you can check if this port is realy listening:

        terminal:
        > sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

        > sudo lsof -nP -i:5054

        Feel free to use any other method to check open ports from netstat to nmap or whatever https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-check-open-ports

    ###### Configure Firefox Proxy Access

    1. In firefox go to `settings`. 
    2. Search for `proxy` and find: "Network Settings: Configure Firefox Proxy Access"
    3. Click on `Settings...` and open up the "Connection Settings: Configure Proxy Access to the Internet" window
    4. Switch to the `Manual proxy configuration` Radio Button instead of "Use system proxy settings"
    5. Delete the value of `SOCKS Host` if you use it for tor or something. For example port 9031. `OR` just leave it as it is. Doesn't matter.
    6. HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1` Port: `8080` 
    7. Tick the "Also use this proxy for HTTPS" checkbox
    8. Click `OK`
    9. See if everything is running: go to google.com for instance
    10. If not: go to `http://burp` or `127.0.0.1:8080` and click on `CA Certificate` to download the `cacert.de` file
    11. firefox `Settings`>`Certificates`>`View Certificates...`>`Authorities`>`Import`>`cacert.de`
    12. Tick the `Trust this CA...` checkboxes and click `OK` (if you wanna get rid of it later you can find it here as `PortSwigger CA` Software Security Device)
    13. Click `OK` in Certificate Manager
    14. Now `google.com` should load. Try it
    15. Now go back to `Burp`>`Proxy`>`Intercept` and click the `Intercept is off` button to turn it on.
    16. Refresh `google.com` or load any site in firefox and come back to Burp to check what you've got. Now you need to see a bunch of good stuff.

### 3.1. Flag0

#### Steps to reproduce the issue:

0. Go to the `login` page ./login
1. Turn on `Interception` in Burp
2. Type `admin'` into the `Username` field on the `login` page and hit enter
3. In `Burp`>`Action`>`Send to Repeater` the toggle message interception
4. Find out the SQL Injection you have to send as a request to get a `status: 200` back. For example you could try this: `username=admin' UNION SELECT '1234' AS password FROM admins WHERE '1'='1&password=1234` then hit the `Send` button. See you get a `status: 200`
5. Turn off `Interception` in Burp
6. On the `login` page type `admin' UNION SELECT '1234' AS password FROM admins WHERE '1'='1` into the `Username` field and `1234` to the `Password` field then hit `Log In` and thats it. Now you are logged in as an admin and can see even the `Private Page` and have all the privileges
