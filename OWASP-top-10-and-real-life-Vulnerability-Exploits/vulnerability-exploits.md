## Installing Webgoat

We don't describe all requirements as for now. Maybe at some point in the future.

Pull this dockerhub repository into your local hub with docker If you haven't already:
> docker pull webgoat/goatandwolf

List all the docker containers:
> sudo docker ps -a

Start the container:
> sudo docker container start 'name-of-the-container'

Again
> sudo docker ps -a

to find the `port` our docker container is now runing on.

In a web browser type the `port` in the address field.

For example:
> localhost_3000

or
> localhost:8080/WebGoat

Now `Disconnect` from the `Internet`!

```
"
terms of use: 

While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack.You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program. WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize the exposure.

This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you. Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the first thing that all hackers claim.
"
```

to stop the server:
> sudo docker container stop 'name-of-the-container'

Next we will go through the following forms of techniques (the goal is to get familyar with them):
- Encoding
- Hashing
- Encryption
- Signing
- Keystores
- Security defaults
- Post quantum crypto

### Base64 Encoding

Encoding is not true cryptography, but it is widely used in various standards related to cryptographic functions, especially Base64 encoding.

Base64 encoding is a method used to convert any type of byte data into a specific range of bytes, which are ASCII-readable. This makes it easier to transfer binary data, such as secret or private keys. You can even print or write these encoded values. The process is reversible, so with the encoded version, you can recreate the original data.

For more details, you can refer to Wikipedia. Essentially, Base64 goes through all the bytes and converts each set of 6 bits into a readable byte (8 bits). This results in the encoded data being about 33% larger than the original.

Examples:

- "Aye" becomes "QXll"
- "09gxH" becomes "MDlneEg="

#### Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is sometimes used by web applications and utilizes Base64 encoding. Therefore, it's crucial to use Transport Layer Security (TLS, commonly known as HTTPS) to protect the username and password from being read by others when sent to the server.

Example:

```bash
$ echo -n "rece:ficeBOOMx3" | base64
cmVjZTpmaWNlQk9PTXgz
```

The HTTP header will look like this:

```makefile
Authorization: Basic cmVjZTpmaWNlQk9PTXgz
```

Now, suppose you intercept the following header:

```makefile
Authorization: Basic dW1wYTpsdW1wYQ==
```

What are the username and password?

solution: 
> echo -n "Base64 encoded string" | base64 -d && echo -e "\n"

Note: I already know much more advanced cryptographic content from the Codecademy Data Science course. Sometimes it gets a little annoying. I'm running circles. But anyway I do it for the hacking. Hopefully I'll come up with something challenging soon.
